Multirotor Flight Controller for the Robotics Cape

Please don't use this and expect it to work the way you want it to!!!!!
I wrote this purely for my own use. NOT FOR PUBLIC USE!!!!
It comes with no warranty, no manual, and I won't answer questions about
how it works. If it breaks something, you get to keep both pieces.

However, enough people have asked me for it so here it is.


Note: depends on libjson-c-dev & libjson-c3
sudo apt install libjson-c-dev libjson-c3

also libroboticscape >v0.4.0
